Although I'm not entirely sure about that, he acts like a blind cat and his eyes look like it is blind too. At first we thought it's just stuck together because he seems to have cold symptoms. then we noticed him running, climbing or moving around by completely depending on his nose and listening. This kitten has a calm temperament. He is a very gentle kitten and is not afraid of humans since he haven't seen how big we are. He climbs things and jumps too. He likes being pet and cleaned and purrs too. He recently learned to follow clucking sound we make with out tongue and follows. I am sad to see this kitten being outside and fear he might get hit by cars. He doesn't know how to avoid vehicles or anything big and moving fast. He will just get scared and sit at the same spot. Now he had started crossing the road from one side to the other depending completely on his nose and ears. I wish someone would be kind to adopt this blind but otherwise healthy kitten and care for his medical requirement. At least for his flu. Although the flu is not serious yet. Even a temporary foster parent will help a lot. He is the only kitten who has survived from the litter despite being blind.The chances for him to survive here is scarce, especially with the cars passing. Many kittens have been road-kills here. He has even survived being washed away in the drain and climbed out by himself. He's a strong willed cat and will definitely live if given the chances.

1,A Special Girl With Loving Names,120,141,0,2,4,5,7,3,1,3,3,3,3,1,0,41326,262134564eade307d2f5e2bb009d13d6,0,"'Old doesn't make one redundant'...This is the story of a special girl with every loving name. She is sadly Heartworm positive and will be treated for it..She was officially fostered on the 13th of Feb and will be under the care of a very kind samaritan for 2 months. We hope a suitable person would come forward to welcome her with open arms with a forever home..we know she is at that age but has been through a lot. Can you imagine having a choke collar on yourself, your whole life? See the 'rafia' tied on her choke collar? Yes, I got it snipped off and hopefully the fosterer would be able to get her choke collar off. What is wrong with human beings! The Starbucks trip could wait, Starbucks won't go anywhere. Even if one Starbucks gets demolished, more would appear..But there are billions of animals in need and there will always be one buddy or clara or we will call her every loving name in the entire world!..Just like there is only one of us out of the billions of people out there. If you want a dog that is just there as an accessory or if you just want a dog that is healthy, I guess you don't have to read further but I hope the least you could do is place yourself in her shoes and share about her. I been asked if her chances of being adopted is high. I don't have a crystal ball people, I'm not God either so your question is bizarre to me, but as bleak as it may seem to many of you, I want to remain hopeful that a responsible and caring adopter would come forward wanting to care for her like a child who would stand by their elderly parent with ailments. Buddy was sent to me I believe..God had a task for me on that day. That day where a man cockily rang the bell and asked me to place water for the dog. Of course I would though I was put off by him. Man claimed dog followed him from the bus stop but he was reluctant to stay even for one minute with the dog while I gathered the food, the water? Doesn't click. Dog wanders up and down..people, hah, people were so unkind in general. I could go 'excuse me sir, excuse me, excuse me maam' and what? They just ignored me. To top it off, employer appeared displeased with the dog's presence, but adviced on placing food at the bus stop and just letting her wander off. If one knows me well enough, such 'advices' goes into into my left ear, out through my right ear. I made calls in secrecy. Managed to find a neighbour of this kind couple who housed her for two nights. 8 am the next day, I had to collect her. Would be at work with me but I was only allowed to place her outside of the clinic (yup, I work in an animal clinic indeed). Imagine the scorching heat, imagine the thunder, the rain and I couldn't. Mind you, couldn't even board her. Not because I had no money. I was simply not allowed to. As shitty as that was, good thing, I went by what I stood for and I wasn't a moron to listen to such advices. I've my own personal values. I would have slept with her outside of the clinic at night if that was what it took even because no way was I going to leave her to fend for herself. Thankfully a kind lady contacted me through the internet and agreed to foster her for 2 months. So again fellow Malaysians or expats or people holidaying here etc, before you go for your next Starbucks fix or debating on what clothes to buy, please take a moment and reflect on this. The fosterer and me are really hoping we could find a suitable person to give her a permanent home...We want the end of her days to be filled with love, compassion... If you are that person, please contact me Yasmin at. Its best for you to sms me first because I work such long hours. More pictures and any necessary updates will be provided. We can't predict what will happen within this two month period but..we do need fosterers as a back up.. So please, we could end up like Clara..alone, lost, left to wander about when we're old, hoping for the mercy of another human being. Think about it. Someday, we could be sitting outside of Starbucks, begging for dough..from the outside, looking in and all of the 'too caught up with the Starbucks buzz' people who reminded you of yourself when you were younger would all turn a blind eye at you and hey, remember back then that dog you didn't want to give your time for? Reality would blow you real hard when you see a dog wandering on the streets, comforting you. Just think about it. Its no Hollywood script. Its reality. Think about it. If what I just wrote does hit you somewhere, then hit me up. Otherwise, just turn the page. Kindly, Yasmin",f3b52a69c,4.0,2

Some videos: Giant and his tennis ball- Giant playing with Snoopy- Giant being bullied- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Due to the overwhelming response from my last email (I got close to emails/ sms/ calls), I am sorry but I need to lay down some ground rules. Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this email and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the terms and conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many emails from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. 1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. 2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. 3) Please DO NOT delete my email with all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. 4) This email is dated 2 February . This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. 5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 5 points, please read on: 6) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. 7) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email): - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with: - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before 8) No reservations please. First come first served. 9) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way. 10) If you need clarifications, please call Ryan at.",b912b1114,5.0,2

She was rescued underneath an abandon car called home as her tiny head was stuck in the car's metal bar or something and she was unable to free herself. I guess she was stucked there for almost 2days or so coz after I freed her, she kinda stumble in her walk. Then I realized she's blind as there is no reaction in her eyes movement when my fingers go near her eyes and she walk without direction. I took her in hopefully to adopt her permanently but I am staying in condo. And about a week plus or so, I noticed that she can actually see because she was following my cats around. I thought its because she can hear them or smell them, but no its not. SUNNY IS NOT BLIND! That was a good news. And now she is super naughty and enjoys playing w the cats and eats w them. But she still need a proper place especially a landed property or garden she can run around. And she will bark and make noise one day and condo is not a place for her.

Will you be my furever friend? _______________________________ Back story, we feed a bunch of strays in our area and did not manage to get one of the female dogs to be spayed in time so out pop-ed 5 little angles. We are still struggling to get our older foster dogs adopted so we thought it would be okay to leave this family where they were. But the weather was very unkind and it rained during most of the night. As a result, this furry family ended up not having a warm place to sleep at night so we decided to take them in, give them whatever we can. Unfornutely, 2 of the puppies did not make it. RIP. However, we have 3 very strong and bright puppies up for adoption, Winnie, Oreo and Minnie! They were born on June 29th (which makes them a month old today!)

Got a friend to check him out while I rush to my appointment and he was not found. After 9 hours, passed by again and saw him at the exact same spot waiting. Once I stopped my car, he came towards me wagging his tail. I'm VERY sure this is a dumping case, because there is no strays around or pregnant female dogs at the nearest strays area. This is what humans are capable of. He is probably just 4 months old, don't even know what is going on or how to fend for himself. He has got dandruff all over his top fur. And he looks so hungry. We named him Leshem, meaning precious. Because life is precious no matter in which form. He has been treated at the vet, showered, dewormed and vaccinated. He is back home with us now while waiting for a forever home he can count on as family. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets.",7adf54516,7.0,3

By the way I name him ""TWENITU"", because I met him on the / :-) So, I appeal to anyone who is willing to take care of TWENITU to contact me. In the meantime, I will make sure it is in good health and the doctor advised me to bring it back to the clinic after a week for the vaccine etc. Thank you.",bb2808ff8,3.0,1

She was very skinny and they knew they had to help her. Unfortunately they're very allergic to cats so i'm sweet pea's foster mum now. While i was driving to my friends' place to pick up sweet pea i saw a tiny furry lump in the middle of the LDP highway. It was Oliver! I dashed out and grabbed him then picked up sweet pea and off we went to the vet! What a miserable trio we were. Both kittens were weak, dehydrated, and sickened by awful intestinal infections. Poor sweet pea had scratches on her face probably from a run-in with an adult cat. Little oliver was bleeding from his mouth and bled all over my skirt. The good news is they're both well on the road to complete recovery thanks to my regular vets. Sweet pea is about 3 months old with a white coat and pretty eyes. Oliver is a growing 6 week old Marmalade male with a tiny midget tail. They're playful rascals who like to wrestle with each other and enjoy a nice warm cuddle with people. These two needs lots of attention and responsible, caring families to care for them. They need PERMANENT homes. Vaccinations and neutering/spaying are compulsory for adoption. These two have had enough horrible experiences with the outside world. They are to be kept strictly indoors. Will post photos as soon as they're done with their courses of antibiotics.

Poor babies were only 1 week old at most, they still haven't opened their eyes yet. They had to be fed through a bottle because they were so young. But miraculously, one of our foster cats (Miu Miu who we rescued and had a huge tumor on her stomach removed. Miu Miu was nursing our other rescued cat, Jamie also.) was kind and generous enough to nurse them and help take care of them.

Much appreciated. --------------------------------------------- His story : 25th May As we returned home from work, as we pass through Puchong we saw a cage left outside the old veterinary clinic of St Angels Puchong. There it was a Cairn Terrier alike and her 6 puppies. Very highly possibly a dumping case from a backyard breeder. Her puppies looks like just a few days old. Trapped in a small rusty cat cage, matted hair, smelling horrible and poo all around the cage. If we leave them there, they will have no chance at all. So home they went with us. When we arrived home, it was further proven that she once had an owner, is trained and is used for breeding. She walks on leash like a trained dog and knows exactly what to do. Initially, she was a little fierce as she must have been in so much fear. After some time, she calmed down a little more. Marnie has got very badly matted hair all over her and very bad tick infestation. Showered and shaved off all her fur. Due to her being around her puppies we do not dare to use too strong of a tick shampoo on her, hence more on manually removing them slowly. She is around 6 years old, puppies are not more than 2 days old. Her legs appears to be very weak, doctor says she is being caged all the time type. So it's most probably used for breeding before this. B2 is one of Marnie's puppies. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets.",fa87afa7d,2.0,2

We weren't sure if she would bite, but luckily she didn't. Carried her out and she was very weak and was also probably in shock. She couldn't even stand. Then a lady came down from the apartments across the road and told us that she had fallen in yesterday. She had put in some bags of leaves and grass (swept by MPAJ) to try and get her to get out, but she just lay on top of the bags and refused to climb out. So the lady fed her yesterday and had come to feed her again today. She was very worried cause no one she knew would help her. Anyway, we have taken her to the vet, and he has discovered that she has recent trauma to her right eye - some internal bleeding. She doesn't seem to have any broken bones but he is worried that there may be some internal damage. So we have taken a blood sample to check and he has given her some meds to support her internal organs while waiting for the results.

Please help if you can offer a loving home for one or more of them, and can committed to loving and caring for them for life. They are probably 2-3 months old, I can't really tell, very friendly and playful, needless to say, extremely adorable. Their mother is owned by a security guard and is tethered to a little guard station in Bandar Seri Damansara area. She gave birth to 12 puppies and the security guard did his best to feed and take care of them, but only managed to get 5 adopted so far. Leaving 7 puppies with their mama, mostly unsupervised, by the side of a street. They have reached the age where they are getting more and more curious everyday and are starting to venture a little bit farther from their mama each day. Other than the obvious danger, outdoor is no place for these puppies to grow up (with the constant rain etc, they will also need to be dewormed, vaccinated, and spayed/neutered). We bought a 30 pound bag of good quality dog food for the guard to lighten his financial burden of having to feed these many puppies and to give the nursing mama some much needed nutrients, but it will not last long. A friend who lives nearby has promised to check on them and give them treats when he jogs/drives by. We have also left a few toys for them to hopefully keep them entertained and keep them away from the street and from wandering too far away. If you are in the area, or know anyone who is thinking of getting a pet, or have connections to rescue groups, please share the pictures of these puppies and help them find their permanent/foster homes. The security guard can be found at Jalan Damar SD15/3 guard house and can be reached at . Rescues are the best breed!

This little boy may not be able to survive in nature because he had a family before. Please do contact me if you would like to be his family.........Thank you so much.",7276be56b,5.0,4

He has on a frayed yellowish collar, so he could've been lost for a while, as he's also very skinny, and he's already neutered when found. Estimated age to be about 1 year old, as he still pees like a gal and has young teeth and good skin. Found in Ara Damansara, though he could've come from anywhere if he's been lost for sometime. He knows how to sit, shake hand and come. He can walk off-leash following people (those who show kindness to him). He sits well in the car. VERY PEOPLE FRIENDLY (so must've been treated very well by humans during his early months). He was hanging around near an unoccupied house in the residential area with the two other dogs despite occasionally being beaten by one particular resident who dislike ""strays."" They also take shelter at a nearby field in the residential area. They've been roaming the area probably since December . If nobody claims him in a week, we'd like to have him adopted! This is a dog that will reward it's keepers with affection and guarding of family property! He is kept at a neighbour's house for a few days, and he will bark at unknown passers-by and unknown cars parked near the house. Would be great if adopters take in another of his buddies from the streets too. He loves attention and freedom. When chained, will whine CONTINUOUSLY for attention if he knows that dog-lovers are within hearing distance. When left to roam free within the compound of the home, he's a real darling! He's quiet, he naps, he's playful when people are around, he's alert when he sees strangers - the perfect dog for a family who'd spend time playing and running/walking him! He makes a wonderful companion dog as well as an alert dog (eg. alert family of possible intruders). Would be great if new owners can take in 2 or more pets. We've taken in this lovely dog and his 2 companions, and he seems to love having other dogs around! Note: SAFE AROUND CATS! He's curious in chasing and approaching them, but non-agressive and stays 2 feet away from usually hissing cats that he approaches! update on: 1st Feb Open for adoption!!! This darling doggie is now kept with another stray who appears to be the ""brother"". The brother was found intact, and when they first started roaming Ara Damansara, was average in weight. however, after roaming for over a month (as sighted by rescuer), he got skinnier and skinnier. The brother is very good on leash, hardly barks, just wags tail when see loving humans and doesn't jump. would be great if a family can adopt BOTH DOGS, as they tend to be happier and quieter and get to play together.",b857d5ac6,6.0,3

The scrawny little tyke was skin and bones. He pulled at my friend's heartstrings and she bundled him up in a box to bring to me for fostering. He had a fungal infection and this had made him lose a lot of hair. After weeks of treatment most of it has grown back and he now has a lovely striped orange tabby coat and an elegant long tail. He is long limbed and lean. A white patch on his chest is the extra touch of cuteness that makes him irresistible. Personality-wise, he is very affectionate and playful. He loves attention and cuddles from both humans and other cats alike. Mischevious, he can often be found wrestling with my other cats or stealing food from my dog. Tom loves attention and doesn't like to be alone. It would be great if he could find a home with other cats or perhaps a dog. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Tom are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter.

They were rescued by Marie, have been spayed and vaccinated. Unfortunately, Marie lives in a condo and yesterday, while her maid was walking the dogs, one of them got loose and approached a resident who happened to be a Malay lady. She was not bitten and the dog didn't even touch her. But she lodged a report to MPAJ and MPAJ has given Marie until Friday to remove her dogs or they will be confiscated! Please call Marie at if you can help. Please share this with all your friends if you can't... ***************** The white one is Isabella (Bella). She can sit and give the paw. She can jump really high. She knows how to walk on a leash. She knows how to poo-poo outside while walking. She has had all her shots and she is neutered. She broke her back leg and she has a metal piece and screws but she has fully recovered. She can be weary of people and growl until she smells them. She doesn't bite but she can look scary when she looks at people a certain way. *********************** The black one is Carlos. He can sit and give both paws. He can sit with both paws up in a begging position. He knows how to walk on a leash. He knows how to poo-poo outside while walking. He has had all his shots and he is neutered. He is a fearful dog and is afraid of his own shadow. He barks loudly but he is never aggressive. Carlos cannot live without Bella- if she is out of his sight, he cries and moans in pain.",69c8c9463,2.0,3

He love to play with other cats but sometimes he will chase them and frighten them, so preferable single cat family, or should try first whether JJ can be accepted by your current cats. Requirements: 1. Bring him for a basic medical check and vaccination after you bring him home. 2. Promise will bring him for needed medical treatment if he fall asick or getting old. 3. Keep indoor, never let him out and put him in any risk to become stray again. 4. Willing to feed above moderate cat food or even good wet food. 5. Promise that you will update us about his recent status or allow us to do home visit once in a while. Only for serious owner, we will do proper interview for his adoption, please understand that cuz we spend many times and efforts to treat his wound during rescued and he is really a human-loving boy, we hope to find him the best adopter :) Wish you are the one.",ce6fe7377,3.0,3

(5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up.

I hate this name. That is why I need a new home with sane owners who will give me a pretty name‚Ä¶ like I deserve! I was found wandering around a bustling urban area. All by myself. My rescuers think I got lost. My foster mama thinks I was abandoned. My vet thinks I was used for breeding. My foster grandmama thinks I was abused. No one really knows my story‚Ä¶ no one really knows my pain. Only I know the suffering I have borne. Only I know the darkness I have travelled through. The sad truth is, I will never see light again. You see, I am blind. My previous owners did not take care of me the way they should have. My eyes and ears need meticulous daily care. My poor teeth need to have plaque-remover applied every day followed by gentle brushing. Because my teeth have deteriorated after years of neglect, I smell a little pungent. And that is where my insensitive foster mama thought it was okay to name me Smellanor! Oh, the nerve! Other dogs frighten me. I don‚Äôt mean to, but when I am afraid I attack. My foster mama says I am no real danger to anyone. Even if I do charge at another fur-dude or fur-dudette I always miss. To be honest, I seldom know where I am. Being plunged into a world of darkness is not easy. I keep bumping into things and falling into holes. My foster mama thinks it is hilarious to call me Stevie Wondress. That woman needs to get tested! I am old, tired and gray. All I want is a healthy arm to be my stay. I pray that someone will adopt me just to love me and protect me. I am house-trained and extremely obedient. Never will I bark, or bite, or disappoint you. Never will I leave your side, until I leave this world. If you have room in your home and in your heart, would you let me in? Would you spare me a chance to live happily with what is left of my days? I hope the angels whisper in your ear tonight, so you will find your way to me. I‚Äôll be waiting‚Ä¶",f9e4762d2,11.0,0

HOW COULD ANY HUMAN DO THIS! its unforgiveable! the poor baby is ready to go home. i gave him the heartgaurd to deworm him...and i want the new owner to take him for vacination. i didnt vaccinate him cuz i am afraid what if he is already vaccinated. it doesn't look like a stray dog ofcourse. looks alike poodle a lot cuz of his hair. the only problem is with his leg..it was tied up for several hours which is why he can't walk properly. he is perfectly healthy. he is eating normally but is kind of scared. i would love to keep him at my apartment but sadly i cant cuz its a LARGE POODLE mix. (his paws are big) and i already have 3 dogs at home. i would have kept if he is small breed but i can't cuz the management is very strickt here. please if you are interested kindly call me on.

We recently took him home from the SPCA as an addition to our family but unfortunately, he's been clashing with our resident dog, Sunshine! They just do NOT get along, which is unfortunate as Norman is a great little dog on his own. Norman would be perfect in a one-dog household. He's loving, smart and LOVELY with kids. Very friendly with people and other dogs - except ours! Actually, our first dog is the one with the territorial issues. Norman is already neutered, housetrained and learning his commands quickly. He's a 2.5 year old schnauzer-poodle mix. He has been vaccinated and dewormed, I have also had my vet examine him (all at great expense) - he is in perfect health. I have also had him tested for heartworms - and he is negative and has been given a yearly heartworm vaccination. Please get in touch if you'd like to adopt him. I do not want to send him back to the SPCA if I can help it, but my family and Sunshine cannot put up with the dog-fights and chaos in our home (the dogs live indoors) for much longer. It's been 2 weeks since we brought him home and it's just not working out. I think Norman would be perfect for you if you don't already have a dog in your home. Though I do not think the fault lies entirely with Norman, our other dog was here first! Please sms me ONLY if you are serious and willing to take him on soon, and I will call you back. We are probably only going to foster Norman for a few more days before we take him back to the shelter :-(",da5d1c5ba,3.0,1

BonBon was the only survivor from 5 siblings and was abandoned by her mother so I took her in. She used to be alone. I let her stay in my house with my other cats so she can have friend. She doesn‚Äôt mind being around with the adults and just be herself. She is playful, independent and sweet. Her energy level is high and she is very active. She doesn't really like to be cuddled. She likes to play rough. She doesn't meow a lot. She can get along with other cat; just give her time to adjust. She is suitable with a home with 1 or two adult cats. Younger kitten may be bullied by her because she is the baby in my house. Important : This is not an average pet, a cat who will sit on your lap, who love being petted and cuddled. I have her almost 2 months, and catching her to trim her claws or just to hold her still is an ordeal.But she really likes to play, all my cats will lose interest but she's the only one who still eye-balling the toys e.g feather teaser.She never comes to me and rubs herself just like my cats greet me. The only time she's interested to me is when it's feeding time or when no one wants to entertain or play with her. Sometimes she bites to get what she wants. I can give you some advice on how to handle her. If you want her to keep another cat company, she is perfect! And pretty low-maintenance,you can just give her food and water and that's it. Please give BonBon a loving home. With love, patience and affection from you, I'm sure she will be the most loving bouncy furkid you ever had.

The rescuer had seeked our services in bringing Rex personally to the clinic for treatment and to be boarded. He has been boarded in the clinic since March and is looking for a loving home. Efforts are being made to make this happen for Rex. Rex needs someone who will patiently want to know him for who he is. Rex loves to play fetch and he loves to gnaw on his chew bone. He loves them dental treats too :) A perfect guard dog because this boy is alert at all times, forget tip toeing away because he notices everything! Once he builds his trust in you, you could certainly find a loyal friend in him. His favourite past time is to sit and watch the world go by with you. Honesty is the best policy and these are my thoughts - Boarding is part of the services provided but it isn't the main function. If I'm lucky during my working hours, I could spend up to an hour plus with him but those days are harder to come by. Otherwise its after my working hours / when I'm off / working half day. His walks are only limited to the clinic's back lane and his view of the world is decreasing as months pass by in my opinion. Picture this, put ourselves in his shoes, who likes the same old mundane view and then its back to being caged the rest of the time and the cycle repeats? I get it that the rescuer is financing his stay but one must be realistic. I just don't think its healthy for Rex or any animal per say to be boarded for a long time, and in Rex's case, is he still going to be boarded until the end of the year? Next year? Look into his eyes..tell me you don't see what I see? There is a story there..All he needs is someone who is willing to decode it. His eyes do look sad to me too, its like as though he is crying out and wondering is this what his life is going to be like? Rescuing an animal is one thing but you also have to think about the animal's wellbeing too since he has been here since March! Its not about the money, its about his happiness. Other animals they come and go and Rex? He is just here. Its heartbreaking to see his life at a standstill like this. Just awaiting for someone to adopt him and the wait has extended for months and months. I do feel it a lot since I am the one who has the most contact with him. If I hadn't vigorously started getting the word out about Rex, no one would have really heard about him. The rescuer has never once visited him, nor was there any posters or flyers made on her part to be distributed. The last time she had asked about Rex was ages ago. If human beings could get depression, animals could too. Please introduce yourself by calling / e-mailing / dropping by the clinic if you want to give Rex a chance to be himself again..

Can't take in another dog as I already have a Shih Tzu of my own. Will put him up for adoption if cannot find his owner in 7 days. If anyone is interested to adopt him please send me an e-mail. This dog is well taken care of by his previous owner, nails are trimmed, no ticks nor fleas and he doesn't bark much. He is potty-trained too. He pees and poos outside the house. UPDATE (17 June, ): Re-captured Bravo in the neighbourhood. He looked tired and weary. This doggie has a habit of escaping by jumping through the high gate and window after getting warm shower, food, and shelter (for a night or two) from the rescuer. He has made ""Running Away"" his lifetime profession and it really broke our hearts. Thus, we have no choice but to put him up for adoption. We do not believe in caging or putting a leash on the dogs. In Bravo's case, it is different. If we are not careful, he'll escape once again (he's a good jumper). Today we brought him to the nearby vet to check if he has a microchip embedded in his body. But the scanner couldn't locate any. Therefore any attempt to find the original owner is futile. (In addition, I believe its master also gave up long time ago on a runaway delinquent like Bravo.) So if you are STILL interested to adopt Bravo, please contact me. Breeders‚Äô requests will not be entertained. We‚Äôll scan through all the prospective candidates to find Bravo a good home. UPDATE (18 June, ): Due to overwhelming responses and my phone number becoming a hotline, I have decided to post up my questions (here) for those who are interested to adopt Bravo. Please e-mail your reply to me. Do NOT post your answers in the comments section. 1) Name: 2) Phone: 3) E-mail: 4) Age: 5) Profession: 6) Do you live in your own property? (Yes/No) 7) Do you stay in a house/flat/apartment/condo? 8) Will there be someone at home when you are away for work or school? 9) Do you have a pet of your own? (Pet's details - Name, age, dog/cat, spayed, etc.) 10) Do you cage your pets? Why? 11) If your pet doesn't want to eat its food, what will you do? 12) How are you going to manage or take care of a dog which makes ""Running Away"" its lifetime profession?",1528d2a61,12.0,2

He just got into the pound earlier that day and was very traumatized as he was been dragged by the noose. I was only able to bail him out from his other three siblings.

Initially, he was afraid of humans as he was dragged by the pound guys by the noose. Now, he has managed to break out of his shell of fear and deemed free of all those dangerous diseases one can find in a dog from the pound. Vaccinated and dewormed.

As i drove, he cautiously crept over from his seat and crawled onto my lap where he began purring loudly. he's such a sweet and appreciative little furball!! Smokey loves being cuddled and hugged. He'll come and sit on your lap anytime you're not moving. He's not afraid of other cats or even dogs.. In fact on his first day at my house he initiated friendship with my foster dog Molly. Smokey has a good appetite and playful affectionate demeanor. He is litter trained and loves attention from people. He's on the quiet side but very sociable and loves to explore.

He is a tiny little guy. Pale golden cream tabby with white paws and belly. Right now his eyes are blue but they will probably develop as he matures. He is fully potty trained and is on a diet of baby cat food mixed with warm water (to soften it). Personality wise, he is very adaptable. We pulled him off the streets scared and untrained and within a day he figured out the cat box. Within two days he was coming over to sit on our laps and cuddle!

I am eager to learn and crave attention in spite of some character quirks that require patience. Please read on to understand more about me."" -------------------------------------------------------------------- Details: - Female, 10 months old, mix of Coon (father) and Ragdoll (mother). Has a beautiful white + fawn coat with blue eyes. Character: - Fayja is a very loving girl and ADORES people. She has an outgoing personality and will adjust to any situation really quick. Loves to play, play, play and hardly tires herself at every invite! She enjoys being pet, stroked and even kissed (although not a fan of being carried). She will come to you when she wants a lap to lie on (she will struggle off if made to do so). - Fayja has a tendency to get overexcited whenever she sees humans and will roll around, purr and sometimes play-bite. She knows how to inhibit herself, however and will lick you afterwards. This instant excitement is probably from her previous life mostly caged - and lack of attention. She understands a simple firm ""no"" in such circumstances. - She has a jealous streak around other cats although she is curious (big NO for kittens), will do best as a single cat. She dislikes others being stroked or pampered in her presence, will lay herself and nuzzle as close as possible to her person to prove this point. - Fayja has been vaccinated, dewormed, spayed and given Advocate spot-on. She is not at all fussy about food and is very clever with the litter box. *** Note For Potential Adopters (PLEASE READ) *** - Fayja ""nips"" as a show of affection very often, hence experienced adult owners preferred (homes with children will not be suitable). - She needs a % indoor home. NO apartments (unless you have maintained a cat-safe environment for many years). - Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire for more info, this is for any cats long term welfare. - Small reimbursement fee will apply, please inquire. Health card will be passed to successful adopter. Please drop me a text or WhatsApp if you feel that you may be just the right person to take this girl home. Thank you!",d9f692e74,6.0,2

Potential adopters should be able to commit to: 1) walking the dogs 2x a day (or keep them in secured bungalow/semi-d/corner house with vast area to roam, as they love running and playing) 2) spend time playing with them (they're still quite young, and will whine for attention unless given regular affection-time with keeper) 3) give fresh water daily & proper food (they eat kibbles) 4) keep shoes in proper shoe cabinet cos one of them is still displaying puppy behaviour of chewing shoes or moving them around (unless he gets adequate exercise and attention) They appear to be brothers, and was roaming Ara Damansara area when found. Plus points about these dogs: 1) trainable: know how to sit/shakehand/come 2) loves children and will play with kids - excellent FAMILY PETs! 3) chase cats (but don't attack them) 4) will bark at strangers - good alert dogs! 5) friendly to keeper and friends 6) great with older folks because of gentle nature - makes excellent FAMIlY PETs! 7) get along with other dogs, even male dogs (possibly because not fully sexually mature and also very gentle + playful in nature), so can join family with existing dogs.

Two weeks ago MPSJ dog catcher came over to catch stray dogs at my house area. One female dog got abandoned here few months ago and she has been here for so long. She stays at my street right in front of my neighbors house. The reason was my neighbors dog made her pregnant and since then she was there with 7 puppies, right in front of the husbands house. I love her but I cannot take her in coz I already have four. That day she almost got caught. So I told myself if she comes back safe from her hiding place I will rescue her. Praise The Lord that she came back safe that evening. I took her in and showered her. My neighbor told me that all her puppies are either dead or got caught. She is now vaccinated, spayed and dewormed. Blood test at the vet also showed healthy status. I need someone to adopt her. Or maybe if you can't adopt just help me to foster her till I find her a new home. I can't release her back on the street as I travel very often for work and I don't want her to be caught when I am not around. Please share this message to ppl you know who wants a dog too.

Disebabkan ada banyak anjing di kawasan ni selepas jam 3 pagi, (itu pun jiran2 sekeliling yg bagitau sbb sy baru berpindah ke sini) sy amek keputusan untuk bawak ke rumah saya. His fur has been shaved because of hairball here and there, and also has been neutered. Bobby still in recovery process but he is healthy and eat a lot, his fur is getting softer than before because I give him a salmon oil and special food for his fur and his body getting heavier as well :) I would love to keep him as my pet, but I already have five cats in the house.

We fell for her the moment we saw her because she was unlike any other stray dogs to us. Klover has the brightest of eyes and the most alarming German Shepherd like ears! Though we were strangers to her at first, she kept coming close to us with her head nudging our legs asking for a pat on her head, in her way :) We took Klover home becuz we wanted to look for a home for her to live in. The outside can be extremely dangerous and we would not allow her to be caught by the authorities. My mom and I wish to take her under our care permanently but we can't do that because we're living in a condo. It would be mean of us to keep her in such a small area because she's big and more of an outdoorsy doggy. She is of camel and kangaroo brown colour with a white chest. Klover is very loving and passionate towards her caretakers. Throughout her stay here with us, she has been with me from accompanying me whenever I nap to accompanying me whenever I do my study revisions. Klover is rather playful and always opts for a belly rub. She doesn't make much noise as she doesn't bark much. However Klover girl would make this doggy ''purr'' whenever she loses sight of you. That purr literally melts my heart everytime :) Klover deserves a family who is able to give her lots of love and care. She would be better off living in a house with a compound bcuz after all that is one of the main aspects we're looking for in a home for her. I'm also pretty sure she'll do well with a family with kids. Gentle Klover is a total sweetheart, I can guarantee you that. She's so sweet and very loyal. All Klover needs is a good home :)",05e3bc1ae,2.0,4

1,Gabby,5,307,0,2,1,0,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,100,41336,c5625ac2fb76c2b948f5133424ffeafc,0,"Gabby is a beautiful sleek black puppy, estimated to be at 3 months old when she turned up. That was in March . Gabby is a lovely quiet dog that hardly barks. She loves to sit and watch us when we are gardening, or sit with us when we are at ease at the porch area. Our friends who visited us, remarked what a gentle soul Gabby is. The children had no problems playing with her as Gabby is not rough. We have recently had a BBQ party & we've received encouraging remarks that Gabby does not paw, bite or disturb any of the guests when they eat or drink. Gabby was lured to our neighborhood by an irresponsible family who was unable to care for her. We gave our home as Gabby's shelter, in order for Gabby to be safe from traffic, pedestrian abuse and harsh outdoor weather. This beautiful puppy is growing up in our compound and is turning out to be a gentle dog who loves long walks, tummy rubs, sitting with us during evenings, and lots of loving attention. We would like to find Gabby a forever home with a loving family as we are unable to be home at all times. Our job takes us on long outstation trips, and it makes it difficult for us to care for her in the long term. While we are not around, our neighbours are understanding enough to watch over her until we get back. Should anyone be interested in adopting this gentle black female pup, do contact me. I will reply as soon as I am able. FAQs Q : Is Gabby trained in anyway? A : Yes. Gabby's been sent for a Temperament Testing by a professional dog trainer. Gabby is also trained to know Basic Obedience commands (eg; Sit, Stay, Down...etc). Should Gabby's adoption be successful, the adopter will inherit her original file as proof of the training she has gone through, including the contacts of the dog trainer. Q : Will Gabby defecate / soil our porch area? A : No. We have trained her to understand that she is to do her business only while outside of the home. The adopter(s) must commit to walking Gabby twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening, everyday. Q : How long should these dog walks be? A : Anything from 15mins and above should do the trick. As long as Gabby gets her walks, gets to do her business, she will be a happy dog. And a happy dog makes a happy master :) Q : Is Gabby spayed, dewormed and generally checked for good health? A : Yes. Her medical records are all with our trusted vet. You will also be given her medical book for proof and as a reference to her visits to the vet. Q : Why the fees? A : We have taken pains to ensure that Gabby's properly vaccinated, dewormed, anti-flea/ticks, fed healthily, socialised (used to human interactions) and above all, trained for Basic Obedience commands to allow the adopter to have a much more easier time with the new pet. Our fees includes : 1. A sleeping cot 2. her favourite toys 3. medical book 4. file & certificate (certified by a pro trainer) 5. Walking leash & collar Q : I / We have never had a pet dog before, how will I know if I am doing the right thing? A : Don't worry. We will spend time with you and Gabby to teach you how to maintain her good habits and training in order for the transition to go smoothly. This will usually take about 2 to 3 hours. Should you have any questions, you may contact us for further advise as well. We will be happy to help you feel at ease with your newly adopted pet until you are ready to be on your own with Gabby. Temperament Testing & The Suitable Adopter : As Gabby has undergone a professional Temperament Test by our trusted dog trainer, we are delighted to share with you on the sort of suitable owner(s) she will be comfortable with. 1. If you are a family, your children should be at the age of 12 or above, and will not be afraid of dogs. All family members should also be responsible, take turns for practising & maintaining Gabby's training to ensure her obedience. 2. If you are a single person, you should be one of a stable routine & with a commitment to taking care of Gabby for the rest of her life. In return, you will have the most loyal and affectionate companion for life. 3. Gabby has been tested as a gentle dog with a friendly disposition. She is not aggressive nor is she territorial. She will love any attention you can give her, but she is also capable of being on her own most of the times as long as her basic needs (daily walks, food, drinks, play, training) are met. 4. Gabby is good on her own as the only dog in the household. If you have another dog, and would like to adopt Gabby as a companion, it would be advisable if your dog is also given a temperament test to determine if your dog is compatible with Gabby. Gabby is Not Good with aggressive and dominant dogs. Also note, if you wish to have Gabby as a companion to your existing dog, all her training could be for naught if your dog is not trained to listen to commands. Preferential treatment will render all of Gabby's training useless. 5. If you have a cat, have no fear! Gabby is friendly and docile towards felines of all kinds. In fact, Gabby is a cat-magnet in our neighbourhood. To date, she has ""rescued"" two kittens (one adopted, one in foster care) and is not aggressive towards cats, she just wants to play with them mostly. 6. Gabby has received the first Basic Obedience Training. Should you wish to pursue the next course, she is ready for the second stage : Intermediate Training (with more detailed & varied disciplinary commands). Requirements for adoption : As we have faced many set backs in regards to the adoption of our rescued pets, we would like for any potential adopters to meet these basic criterias before contacting us : 1. As an adopter, you should have your own landed property (not rental - neither owned by the company you work for nor renting under another name). This is to avoid any future problems such as re-homing the pet. 2. As an adopter, you should have a stable & existing job to provide for the adopted pet's every need. 3. Adopted pets should never ever be abandoned again if you feel incapable in providing for them. 4. As an adopter, you must realise that when you take on a pet, they will be an addition to your life in every aspect of every way. Adopting a pet is akin to adopting another family member. Love is not enough as all manner of care, responsibility & commitment to their happiness will be in your hands. If you have any doubts, please carefully reconsider all these points mentioned above, so that we may spare the pet (and us) of any unnecessary stress. We love all of our rescues and treat them like our own kids, but we also discipline them without favour. We'd like you to think of them as your own kids too.",86547ad6d,5.0,4

She loves running and playing with other dogs though at times she's a little over-friendly and hyper. A week ago, the fur on her paws started to shed and demodex attack is back.

He has ears that are too big for his head and hence the name. Do not be fooled by his big innocent eyes though because Dumbo can be a cheeky puppy. Dumbo is a very intelligent and active puppy but he may seem a little timid at first. He may take some time to warm up to you but I can assure you that he would be as affectionate and obedient as any puppy could be once he gets to know you. Dumbo has so much love to give to you and your family,731a2ef80,4.0,3

(story background) We found her, her siblings (all 6 of them) and her mummy under an abandoned car in front of a 99 speed mart in Bandar Sunway. Our family came over daily to feed the mummy dog as our initial plan was to wait till all of them are old enough to eat kibbles and put them up for adoption and neuter the mummy dog. However, very very unfortunately, 2 of her siblings fell into a longkang and drowned while one probably wondered abit too far out and got run over by a car. We knew then that we needed to step in and help them! So we took them in. So far, we have managed to get 5 of them adopted and they are so loved and happy! We hope for a happy ending for Molek too! (if you are wondering why we don't just take her in as our own, its cause we already have a lot of dogs, we started out as fosters but ended up adopting many of our foster dogs and now we really cannot take in anymore and it would be unfair for them because we can't give them the attention and affection that they truly deserve!) Sorry for the long winded story, so here is Molek, waiting for a furrrever home. She's extremely bright! Playful, active, sweet and loving! She mixes well with other dogs (benefits of being around other foster dogs)! She's a great guard dog too!

I'm trying to find loving homes for the 4 gorgeous puppies we found and rescued late one night in April. We found the puppies abandoned on a hillside behind where we are staying and I'm sorry to say it looked as if they had been thrown there and left. At first we didn't think they would have the strength to survive after the trauma as their eyes were still all closed and they were no bigger than my hand. How wrong I was! They are clearly born resilient and made a rapid recovery. There have been many sleepless nights of bottle feeding the 4 puppies, trust me we've had our hands full! But now I'm really happy to say that despite their rough start they are starting to blossom into the most lovely little puppies with a fantastic temperament. Sadly, I am only in Malaysia traveling visiting family and diving and I am due to return home to the UK very soon. I have looked into relocating the puppies there but at their age it is very difficult to do so and I fear I will not have enough time or funds to relocate them all. With this in mind I am looking to find them loving families that they can grow and be a part of. They have had weekly check-ups at the vets, of which I have put together individual medical history file for each puppy. These happy and healthy puppies have been de-wormed and are in the process of their vaccinations (receiving their first dose .14)...please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like to arrange to come and see the puppies. xox 12 PAWS LEFT‚Ä¶.!",7e43a342a,5.0,4

Everything a puppy should be. An elderly gentleman fell in love with Coops.

Unfortunately this happy ending was not meant to last forever. Coops elderly adopter can no longer cope with his strong teenage dog. We hope to find Cooper a new home with someone who will love him just as much! He is a very alert dog and knows basic commands in mandarin, cantonese, and english!! He knows how to sit, shake hands with his right paw and then his left paw. He's also housebroken and will only relieve himself during his morning and evening walks. Cooper needs a lot of exercise and space to run around in. He absolutely must NOT be tied up or caged. This would drive him crazy. He is very energetic. He also craves attention and human companionship. He'd love it if someone could play with him often. He is definitely man's best friend. Right now he weighs about 20 kilos and has been recently neutered. He is a healthy, inquisitive boy and doesn't display any aggressive behavior towards other dogs. He is eager to make friends.

He was soaking wet, shivering, full of worms and with a snapped back leg (it stuck out at right angles to his body). It looks to me like somebody stamped on him, whether accidentally or on purpose I don't know. He was too cute to leave sitting there. I took him to the office, and we all nurtured him back to health. For a while we thought his leg might need to be amputated, but he quickly sorted himself out, with a little help from the vet and a lot of love from everybody in the office. Now he's a healthy happy kitten, with insane amounts of energy. He's still a little bit wonky when he runs and pounces, but basically he's % tip top. He's very affectionate, loves people, hates being alone. He's a real lap cat who also loves nothing more than riding round on my shoulders, falling asleep on people and stopping us from doing work. Anything that moves is chased, he'll be a great mouse/cockroach killer. He's fun to play with. He also likes being around other cats. He can be a bit naughty, but is cute enough to get away with it, and he's only young. He's completely house trained, he uses the litter tray (he's most particular about this, was the easiest cat to train I ever had). Sadly he lives in a place of work, where we can't give him enough attention because we're all busy (basically watching him play is a massive time waster for all of us, a great excuse not to work, but). Also, since the office is empty at night he gets lonely and howls. He really needs a loving home, where he can sleep indoors where people are. I wish I could keep him, but it's not fair to Wonky. We're going to get him neutered and vaccinated this week. Please give a call if you want a loving furball in your life. Only nice people who can give him a loving home need apply. We'll want to meet you first, since we all want him to go to a safe place where he can be his crazy self.",835fdb873,9.0,1

He was trained to play rough by a muscular Judo Master. He acts like dog. Whenever he's tired or nervous, he'll start to breath fast, and stuck his tongue out, like a dog. Juliane (his owner) took Boy home for the first time, Boy barks. Later then he learns to meow. Other than Boy, there's Kate. She has nerve problem. Her brain deteriorates day by day and now Juliane focus on Kate who needs full attention. Every time Kate gets panic attack, that's when the brain will slowly damage. So the more panic attack Kate gets, the more brain damage she'll suffer. Because of Kate's condition, moreover Kate can't see other cat else she'll start to get panic, Juliane decide to put Boy for adoption. Boy is at my place (Bubu's Shelter) now. Though he's big, he's domesticate. When he bonds with you, he'll start suckle your palm. That's how he shows affection. I've train him not to play with human hands, but sometimes he does. But he's a fast learner, so if you show that you're angry when he bites your hand or feet, he'll understand his mistake and stop doing it. So whenever he's hyper, make sure you have toys for him. He has also learn how to socialize. Adopter criteria: I need someone who's confident handling him. Better with experience and someone who's responsible and committed. view video of him suckling palm:",70c811b9d,5.0,2

A friend was walking his dogs when they suddenly became excited outside an apartment complex and sniffed out a shoe box. Inside the shoe box was little Charlie! He was about 6 weeks old then, emaciated and dehydrated, just a scrap of skin and bones. He had a bad tummy virus but survived it after two weeks of antibiotics. Now he needs a permanent home! Charlie is very active, playful, and affectionate. He likes playing with other cats and sitting on people's laps. He uses his litterbox without fail. Charlie is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Charlie are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Charlie started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Prison is punishment! Interested parties can text or email me. An introduction of yourself, your experience with cats, and your approach to their care is greatly appreciated. Serious inquiries from responsible cat lovers only please.

Trust me, she really looks like smaller-eyes-version Bolt. This lousy pic of her doesnt justify how cute she is! My friend had adopted her for nearly 2 months. He gave up on her due to her extremely submissive nature. She does well with other dogs but not so much with human. This is because she used to be a strayed puppy before someone picked her up & sent her to the vet. My friend is not a patient owner. He doesnt like the fact that she runs away everytime we go near her. She loves eating & will only come to you when you have food. Although she is a very submissive dog, she still greeted us when we came back from work. At the moment, she is a dog's dog & not so much of people's dog. She doesnt bark much unless she is playing with other dogs. She gets along very well with one of my mongrel dog. So i assume that she has no problem getting along with other dogs. Please bear in mind that she is not a people's dog as she was a strayed dog previously. I m looking for a very patient & loving owner who is willing to spend time with her & take care of her so that she is not reluctant of interacting with human being.

I strayed too far from my mom-cat and like all lost kittens, I meowed / called out for days. Foster mummy heard my meowing from afar. I wasn't aware of it at the time, but she was trying (in vain) to look for me. ‚ô• Then came one stormy and rainy evening. I somehow found my way to foster mummy's backyard. I called out again, and this time foster mummy came outside, determined to rescue me. Boy did I protest hard when she laid her hands on me...hissing, screaming, biting at her gloves! She eventually wrapped a towel around me and everything went dark. ‚ô• I was brought to a quiet room, where the scent of kibbles greeted me. There were several bowls of food and fresh water laid out. I didn't stop to think about anything else, I went straight for my first proper meal in days! ‚ô• I didn't let foster mummy have it easy. The very sight of her walking into the room each day would send me running to a corner (I even urinated a few times out of fear). Still, she remained patient and kept talking to me in a calm voice. She began bringing me treats during each visit and this is when I really started to open up. ‚ô• Fast forward a week ahead, here I am! Any person who sees / handles me today would find it hard to believe that I was once a wild / feral kitten. I purr at the very SIGHT of people and I LOVE being petted, carried, belly-rubbed, you name it! I'm gentle when I play too (no claws) and my favorites are string-toys and anything bushy / crinkly (dusters, papers, brooms, etc). ‚ô• Foster mummy has already taken me to the vet for my first full check-up. I was de-wormed and given a clean bill of health. Now I'm ready for that special / permanent family to share my life with! :) *** PLEASE READ: Note For Potential Adopters *** ‚óò Max-A-Million would like to be kept INDOORS full-time and NEUTERED at the right age. ‚óò Max-A-Million would appreciate some form of premium food (no cheap Whiskas, Friskies, etc).

We already have four adult cats and can‚Äôt really afford to take in one more. So I hope she can go to a kind and understanding owner that will treat her well.

Thank you! : ) Aura & Solar were rescued as part of a 4-kitten litter from a backlane opposite my home on 20 August . and after ensuring that they are in good health and well socialised after almost a month of fostering them, the 2 kittens are now ready to be rehomed. It's difficult to tell them apart as their coat colour and pattern are exactly the same but looking at their eyes, you will be able to differentiate both the kittens. - They have dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM September (RM12) at a total cost of RM30. - They have been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding them with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - Their weights are 0.55kg & 0.65kg as at 12 September . - They're eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - They drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kittens to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage their health and shorten their life. - They're toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - Their poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as their overall health. - Aura & Solar have been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM85. - Aura & Solar's behaviour is perfect as pets as they're completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. They would purr happily when held. They are friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept them too) as they're well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The kittens must be adopted together because they keep each other company (and out of trouble). 2) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Their future when you return to your home country. 3) They must be kept indoors at all times. 4) Vaccinate them yearly to protect against diseases. 5) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 6) The RM adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover their vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Aura & Solar. If possible, please adopt Aura & Solar at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Aura & Solar, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. Looking forward to hearing from you! :)",002278114,13.0,1

She was really frail and quite dirty with a skin condition, and was looking for a kind person to cuddle up to and not so much for food. But of course Malaysians being Malaysians, most of them shoo-ed her away and some even kicked her. The coffee shop owner then informed me that her mother had recently been killed - someone had poisoned her. As I usually have a small amount of dog food with me in the car, I gave her some. She ate a little but just wanted to be petted. She then went to another table curled up at the feet of this old man. Thankfully this man did not kick her. I asked several people if they would take her, but of course none would. In the end, I asked the shop owner for a box and brought her home. I just could not bring myself to leave her there. I took her to the vet and it was confirmed that she had a severe case of sarcoptic mange. She was treated with Ivermectin for 5 weeks and she is now a healthy, active puppy. We're not entirely sure what breed she is, but she looks like she could have some Jack Russell in her and possibly some Dalmation as well as she has quite a lot of spots... She has just received her first vaccination and will be completing the remaining 2 shots soon. She has a very good temperament and is good with other dogs. She is curious about our cat and has shown no signs of aggression towards it. She is very playful and is a fast learner.

They will be having fresh cooked tuna or tenggiri once a week. Body weight is 8.KG (Boy) & 7.KG (Girl). This weight is taken 1 1/2 hour ago before i create this post. For adopter information :- 1) I'm not selling pet - Both of them was given to me by a friend from New Zealand. Yes, im not buying it but the cost from New Zealand to Sarawak is more than Eur1k. 2)Why i charged for both of them? if someone couldn't afford to pay adoption fee then how my cat can live in good environment with new owner? 3)I will show you all certification about both of them. I will hold all documentation about cert/import document/certification document etc. unless you show me how are they for 3-4 months. If i can see they in good hand then i will release all document to new owner. If you ask why? I think everyone know the answer well. Now lets talk about reason : 1)My wife having our 2nd baby and always complaining about not feeling well. Including vomitting when smelling thier dry foods. 2)I tried to get relative's to handle them but most of them have aggressives guard and indoor dogs. 3)My cat never caged. Only in carrier or veterinary hospital for checkup. Thats the reason i couldn't send them to boarding till my wife give birth. That's it.. For Muslim's adopter do not feel worried about my cat. They tooked dry food only. Suppliment also halal product. Wet food once a week gm each of them is plain fresh fish without any ingredient or even fish bone. Giving together all 4 tiers cat tree/bed/pet food/grooming equiptment/shampoo/dry cleaner shampoo/accessories etc. Pet food can last 2-3 months. Warning : No seperate adoption.

They were rescued by a jogger and other passersby and are now in the care of a few fosterers. Tabatha was seriously ill but has fully recovered. She's a survivor. She has a beautiful calico coat, long elegant tail, and big, green eyes. Tabatha is an inquisitive and intelligent kitten. Her curious nature makes her a mischievous tyke. She likes to follow people around and get involved with whatever they are doing. She loves playing with other cats and even cautiously hangs out with dogs. She is always running around, playing with toys and entertaining herself. She is quite vocal and very affectionate. Tabatha loves company and she would be terrific in a home with other cats or kittens and people who have time to spend with her. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Tabatha are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Tabatha is very sociable, playful, fun-loving, and energetic. Confining her in a small space would make her very unhappy. Interested parties may text or email me. A brief introduction of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated.",63d254530,22.0,3

Good quality food is important to maintain their health and more beneficial for you in the long run (less vet visits!) Companions: Cats are very social animals and it is healthier to adopt two so they can have another cat to play or interact with. Especially if you are busy at work or otherwise most of the day :). But if you can only get one cat, then please consider adopting an adult cat. Adult cats are usually litter box trained, spayed and easier to take care. Their personality is developed and you know what you get. They are also more independent and mellow in their games and spend a lot of time napping ;). Medical/vets: My cats are not spayed/neutered if less than 6 months. You must agree to do so at 6 months. You must also agree to give booster shots (if required) and yearly veterinary examination. Other Conditions: I love to receive updates on their progress with pictures. Taking care of fur kids is easy. All they need is some food, lots of love & attention and they will be at your side all their life. But before adopting, please consider your financial situation.
